Flow Control :- Sender and reciever should have the same speed 
1. Stop and wait - sends one frame waits for ack
2. Sliding Window - sends no. of frames then wait for ack

Error Control :- Loss of data or corrupted dataframe (Positive ACK , Negative ACK)
1. Stop and Wait ARQ - sends one frame waits a certain amount of time within which ack should be received
2. Go Back N ARQ - sends a set of frame in the window, but if NACK is recieved the whole set is retransmitted
3. Selective repeat ARQ - same as go back n but if nack is recieved only the frame for which it was recieved is retransmitted
